Winter scene in pure CSS.

This is a pure CSS implementation of a Pythagoras tree with a bit of snow as an
added flourish. By "pure CSS" I mean no extra HTML elements except for the bare
minimum required to deliver the CSS in a valid way, so no `<div class="tree">`
helper elements or anything like that.
